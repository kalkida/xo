And you are just so funny!  \"0 factorial equals 1... if you are wondering why... that's just the way it is.  I don't have an answer for you.\"  This is something that I need to tell my students...LOL!  But on a more serious note I just found out why zero factorial is equal to 1.  Apparently in terms of factorials, zero factorial means an empty set and an empty set can only be ordered one way, so zero factorial is equal to one."
